# azzipPicksGame

Azzip Picks Game was originally designed and created in the Python console with full functionality. Then, tkinter was used to create visual, created by GPT-4.

For easier use among more people, I translated the code into an HTML set up, then used GPT-4 for tips on making the game play, topped off with some CSS to make it look more appealing.

DETAILS ON ADDING MENU ITEMS TO THE GAME
-It takes less than a minute

1. Beginning at line 79 (as of 8.26.25) there is the list of pizzas, by adding a pizza to the end of the list following the format in the code, this will add a pizza to the list that the game will register

2. Next, you must add the ingredients of the pizza to the ingredients section that begins at line 98 (as of 8.26.25), this will automatically create a button for each ingredient.

And just like that, you can test it out with the new changes and will see that a new pizza is added to the lineup and ingredient buttons have been added.
